# The ProjectüéØ

The **goal** of this project is to help building a digital system for an NGO in Spain that distributes food to people in delicate situations.

Currently they carry out their operations with physical forms and manual processes, which causes great inefficiencies in the process and failures at the time of distribution. The organization relies on collaborating entities to distribute food to beneficiaries. These entities are in charge of receiving the food, identifying the beneficiaries and distributing the corresponding meals.
Our purpose is, on the one hand, to develop a web application for entities and beneficiaries. On the other hand, for the NGO the objective is to create a website where they can have a real time view of the operations.

There is a **huge opportunity** to improve the food access of many families in Spain and this could happen **thanks to your contribution.**
